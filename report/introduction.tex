Nowadays, social media has became an important way for people to get news. Compared to the mainstream media, it has larger coverage of events and shows the pressing issues discussed by citizens, can bring awareness and break the bubble. So the event detection in social media is meaningful. However, there is a lot of spam, publicity and false news. What's more, people use unstructured, short text and informal language. So the task of event detection is not easy.

In this project, we use PySpark(Apache Spark in Python) to perform trending detection and analyse on tweet. The data contains tweets in English and French in the first week of February 2020. There are 9 steps in total. Due to the limit of the computational capacity, we use one week of French tweets for the first 4 steps and one day of English tweets for the rest steps.
